# MrBobsMemberRegister

## Synopsis
Mr Bob has been running an art shop since 2016. His business approach is that any artist can become 
a member by registering in the shop. He has to register them manually, capturing details such as 
Surname and Name, the name of the artwork, the category of the work, size of the work, number 
of pieces and expected price etc. Each registered member can place their artwork (painting) in the 
shop for 10 months. They have to pay the rent to Mr Bob to keep their work in the shop. Rent is on 
a daily basis. If he sells any item he gets a 25% commission of selling price. Rent rate is according to 
the size of the art.
